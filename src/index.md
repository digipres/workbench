# Welcome to the DigiPres Workbench

## Tools and technical resources for practical digital preservation

Here you'll find a collection of tools, reports, visualisations and tutorials to help you to preserve your digital collections. You can use the menu on the left or the plots and links below to get started.

```js
import { generate_exts_chart } from "./formats/registries.js";
```

<div class="grid grid-cols-2" style="grid-auto-rows: 504px;">
  <div class="card">${
    resize((width) => Plot.plot({
      title: "Your awesomeness over time ðŸš€",
      subtitle: "Up and to the right!",
      width,
      y: {grid: true, label: "Awesomeness"},
      marks: [
        Plot.ruleY([0]),
        Plot.lineY(aapl, {x: "Date", y: "Close", tip: true})
      ]
    }))
  }</div>
  <div class="card">${
    resize((width) => generate_exts_chart(width) )
  }</div>
</div>

```js
const aapl = FileAttachment("aapl.csv").csv({typed: true});
const penguins = FileAttachment("penguins.csv").csv({typed: true});
```

## Next steps

Here are some things you could try...

<div class="grid grid-cols-4">
  <div class="card">
    <a href="./formats/">Analyse and compare different data format registries</a>, to find out which ones might help you understand your digital collections.
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    Understand the <a href="./publications/">data behind the index of publications related to digital preservation</a>, and the networks beneath.
  </div>
</div>
