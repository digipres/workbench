## Goal

Opening up the strange bitstreams lurking in the long tail of the digital format ecosystem is often time-consuming and difficult. Is it worth it?

We believe it is.

_But we need your help to prove it!_

## Process

Evidence and statistics can only get us so far. To convinced people that these weird bytes are worth our time, we need to find ways to tell the tales of the long tail. 

We need to search for the stories beneath the format profiles. Pluck out the hidden gems from the depths of our collections and polish them 'till they _shine_.

Can we communicate the care we take? The fascination that drives us? The feelings these frozen signals invoke in those who care about their contents?

Lets find out...

## Please Send Us Your Gems For Polishing!

You can get in touch with me [via email](mailto:andrew.jackson@dpconline.org), [via the links on my homepage](https://anjackson.net/), [book a call with me](https://calendly.com/andrew-n-jackson/dpoh), or just leave a note below with enough information for me to find the gem in question.

We will, of course, always run anything we come up with past you before publicising anything you tell us!
