> Most languages are detected by their file extension defined in [`languages.yml`](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/39fd5e93de98de3434cb3e857c5b1972c418f8c5/lib/linguist/languages.yml). For disambiguating between files with common extensions, Linguist applies some [heuristics](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/39fd5e93de98de3434cb3e857c5b1972c418f8c5/lib/linguist/heuristics.rb) and a [statistical classifier](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/39fd5e93de98de3434cb3e857c5b1972c418f8c5/lib/linguist/classifier.rb).
