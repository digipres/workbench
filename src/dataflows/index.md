# Dataflows
## Mapping out how data flows from place to place

## Introduction

Dataflow diagrams show how data gets copied from system to system, over time.  The different places where data can be stored are laid out from top to bottom, and the sequence of events the data can go through are plotted from left to right. The lines of the 'tube map' or 'metro' layout show how the data moves, and you can inspect the event 'stations' to get more information about each event.

### Using OAIS As An Example

The dataflow diagram below shows simplified version of how the Open Archival Information System describes the flow of data through an archive:

```js
import { generateDataflow, enableTooltips } from "./dataflows.js";

// Generate and display the dataflow from the text:
display(await generateDataflow(dfl));
// FIXME Log and show any errors found during parsing of the DFL definition!

// Enable tooltips, which is not automated when generating the dataflow directly:
enableTooltips();
```

Dataflows are defined using a text format that describes the sequence of events:

```
start sip@producer
move sip@producer sip@store "Ingest SIP"
transform sip@store aip@store "SIP to AIP"
space
derive aip@store dip@store "Generate DIP"@N [0,1]
move dip@store dip@consumer "Access"
end
```
The text box below shows the full source for the diagram above, which includes more definitions, details and comments. If you edit it, the diagram above will automatically update, so you can see what happens.

```js
const dflDefault = `dataflow 1.0
title "OAIS High-level Dataflow"
height 300
"""
This is what the OAIS dataflow looks like from the outside. All of the internal detail is invisible to external users.
"""

# First we define the details of the data involved in the flow. 
# This is used to define the colours of the data flow lines:
data sip "Submission Information Package" black
data aip "Archival Information Package" red
data dip "Dissemination Information Package" green

# Then we define the places and the domains those places belong to. 
# The order the places are defined here also defines the order in which they are laid on on the page, from top to bottom:
place consumer "Consumer" dc
place producer "Producer" dc
place store "Archival Storage" ar

# And then a more detail description of the domains:
domain dc "Designated Community"
domain ar "The Archive"

# ----------------------------
# With all the data, places and domains defined, we can start describing the sequence of events.
# Text wrapped in """ contain detailed descriptions for the preceding event.
# ----------------------------

# Start:
start sip@producer
"""Every dataflow starts by declaring what data exists where, before the dataflow begins. <br><br> For OAIS, we always start with a <i>Submission Information Package</i> that is held by a <i>Producer</i> that belongs to the archive's <i>Designated Community</i>."""

# Ingest:
move sip@producer sip@store "Ingest SIP"

# Preserve:
transform sip@store aip@store "SIP to AIP"
space

# Access:
derive aip@store dip@store "Generate DIP"@N [0,1]
move dip@store dip@consumer "Access"

# Show the final state
end

### OAIS In Detail

## Real Dataflows

A number of well-established and long-running digital preservation services have been studied as part of the _Registries of Good Practice_ project.  There are a wide range of successful approaches and strategies, and here we use dataflow diagrams as a way to document what real-life digital preservation looks like.
